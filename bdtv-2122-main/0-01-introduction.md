# Introduction

This workbook is intended as a brief guide to essential elements of the SQL language. SQL is the 
standardised language for relational database management systems, as such an understanding of its 
capabilities is a useful skill to be used when communicating with a database.

This workbook aims to give a context for the different SQL commands by providing a series of 
exercises. Working through the exercises will provide the essential building blocks with the aim that 
by the end of the workbook, you should be able to structure basic SQL commands that will enable you 
to create a database schema, insert and update data and finally perform complex queries to extract 
data from the database.

## Example Code

All the examples used in this work book can be found on Moodle, please download the resources to 
your local device so you are able to access them. All files provided are plain text files, so your 
preferred text editor should be used to edit or view the files.

There are comments in the example files, please read as some code is designed to fail to emphasise a 
point. It is reliant upon yourself to read the comments in the code so that the examples will work 
correctly.

## SQL Environment

To avoid typical installation issues encountered when installing software solution such as MySQL on 
your own devices, the examples in this workbook are designed to be used with a tool called **DB 
Fiddle.**

DB Fiddle is a web based solution, useful in allowing you to prototype and test your own SQL 
without the overhead of a database installation. DB Fiddle can be found [here](https://www.db-fiddle.com/).

### DB Fiddle Overview

Key features of the DB Fiddle appliaction are:

**Database Selector** – SQL syntax differs slightly depending on versions and solution providers. Select 
the target database solution using this dropdown to ensure that the SQL code enters is compatible. 
For the examples in this Workbook, please use ‘MySQL 5.7’.

**Run** – Run button, when Run is clicked, the DDL (SQL written to create and populate the schema) is 
executed first, followed by the DQL (SQL Query Language written to extract data from the schema).

**DDL Entry Area** – Data Definition Language entry area, enter your DDL here. The SQL entered here
will create the schema structure and should populate data in the schema.

**DQL Entry Area** – Data Query Language entry area. The SQL entered is the Query statements 
intended to extract data from the Schema. 

**Query Results Area** – All output generated by the SQL statements in the DQL area are displayed 
here. NOTE: SQL entered in the DDL area is not shown in the output area.

## Using the Sample files in DB Fiddle

Each sample file contains two sections:
- DDL Section
- DQL Section

Ensure each section is copied to the relevant section in DB Fiddle i.e. the section labelled DDL is only 
copied to the DDL area of DB Fiddle, and similarly the section labelled SQL Query is copied to the 
DQL Entry Area.
